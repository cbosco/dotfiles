Chris' Dot Files
===================
Forked from [cspicker/dotfiles](https://github.com/cspicker/dotfiles).

â€¦in turn forked from [ryanb/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).

Requirements
------------

1. Bash 4+ (and bash_completion, if desired)

### Chris' idiot-proof pre-installation on OSX

1. Download XCode from the Mac App Store _or_ download and install only the latest commandline tools from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
2. Get [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
3. `brew install bash` (installs to /usr/local/bin)
4. `sudo vim /etc/shells`
5. Add the bash from homebrew to the list:

		/usr/local/bin/bash
6. `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash`
7. Open a new terminal window or restart the app

Installation
------------

Simply run the following commands:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/cbosco/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    bash install.bash

The install script will create symbolic links to files in your home
directory (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.). If files exist at these
paths, you will be prompted to handle the conflict by overwriting,
skipping or aborting the installation.

I recommend moving any existing shell configuration into ~/.localrc,
which will be sourced if it exists.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

Environment
-----------

> I have used these files on Mac, Linux and FreeBSD systems. I recommend
putting any system-specific configuration, as well as anything else
you don't want in your repo in ~/.localrc.
